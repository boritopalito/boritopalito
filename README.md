## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

âœ¨ I'm a passionate software developer with a particular love for writing code in Java. I thrive on creating robust, scalable applications and often find myself working within the Spring Boot and Hibernate ecosystems. My front-end framework of choice is React, which allows me to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate
- **Frontend:** React

## Interests

âš¡ When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into the world of reverse engineering (thats basically still coding). Currently, I'm focusing on Old School RuneScape (OSRS), dissecting its intricacies and learning from its architecture and design.

ðŸ‘¯ Feel free to connect with me or explore my repositories. Let's build something amazing together!
